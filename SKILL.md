### 3. Configuration-Driven Design
Implements a YAML-based configuration structure that allows for declarative system setup, making the system maintainable and easily modifiable without code changes.

## AI Model Integration & Management

### 4. Multi-Model Strategy Implementation
Integrates diverse AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Grok) across different agents, demonstrating knowledge of leveraging different models' strengths for specific tasks.

### 5. Token Budget Management
Configures `max_tokens` parameters (ranging from 4000 to 12000) for each agent based on task complexity, showing understanding of resource optimization and cost management.

### 6. Model-Task Alignment
Strategically assigns specific models to appropriate tasks (e.g., Grok for reasoning-intensive comparisons, Claude Sonnet for comprehensive reporting), demonstrating advanced understanding of model capabilities.

## Regulatory Domain Expertise

### 7. FDA 510(k) Process Expertise
Demonstrates deep knowledge of FDA 510(k) regulatory pathways, including substantial equivalence analysis, predicate device comparisons, and review requirements.

### 8. ISO Standards Integration
Incorporates multiple ISO standards (ISO 14971 for risk management, ISO 10993 for biocompatibility, IEC 62304 for software lifecycle) into specialized review agents.

### 9. Medical Device Classification Understanding
Shows expertise in medical device regulatory categories including Software as Medical Device (SaMD), Software in Medical Device (SiMD), and various device classifications.

## Document Processing & Analysis

### 10. PDF-to-Markdown Conversion Pipeline
Implements a specialized agent for converting unstructured PDF content into structured Markdown while preserving document hierarchy, tables, and formatting.

### 11. Multi-Format Document Handling
Handles various document types including technical files, clinical data, regulatory submissions, and manufacturing documentation through specialized processing agents.

Implements entity extraction capabilities that identify and catalog 20+ key entities with contextual information, demonstrating advanced NLP application design.

## Comparative Analysis & Evaluation

### 13. Version Difference Detection
Creates a sophisticated diff agent capable of identifying 100+ meaningful differences between document versions, focusing on substantive changes rather than cosmetic edits.

### 14. Predicate Device Comparison Framework
Implements systematic comparison methodology for evaluating substantial equivalence between new devices and predicate devices across multiple dimensions.

### 15. Multi-Dimensional Device Analysis
Structures comparison across technical characteristics, intended use, indications, performance data, and risk profiles for comprehensive evaluation.

## Risk Management & Safety Assessment

### 16. ISO 14971 Risk Matrix Implementation
Develops a specialized agent for creating risk matrices that track hazards, harms, initial risks, mitigations, and residual risks in standardized format.

### 17. Cybersecurity Threat Assessment
Implements dedicated cybersecurity evaluation following FDA guidance, addressing threat modeling, encryption, access control, and patch management.

### 18. Adverse Event Signal Detection
Creates capability for analyzing post-market surveillance data and adverse events to identify safety signals relevant to regulatory review.

## Quality & Compliance

### 19. Standards Conformity Tracking
Implements systematic tracking of consensus standards (ISO, IEC, ASTM) with version control and conformity assessment capabilities.

### 20. Checklist-Based Review Methodology
Generates structured review checklists from regulatory guidance documents, ensuring comprehensive and auditable review processes.

### 21. Quality Management System (QMS) Overview
Provides high-level manufacturing and quality system analysis focusing on aspects directly relevant to product safety and performance.

## Clinical & Statistical Evaluation

### 22. Clinical Evidence Assessment
Implements comprehensive clinical data evaluation including study design, endpoints, statistical validity, and evidence strength for regulatory claims.

### 23. Statistical Method Review
Creates specialized capability for reviewing statistical approaches, sample size calculations, and data presentation integrity in clinical and performance studies.

### 24. Biocompatibility Evaluation Framework
Applies ISO 10993 standards systematically to assess biological safety based on contact type, duration, and risk profile.

## Technical Assessment Capabilities

### 25. Software Safety Lifecycle Review
Implements IEC 62304 compliant software review covering architecture, safety classification, verification & validation, and change control.

### 26. Sterilization & Shelf-Life Validation
Evaluates sterilization methods, validation protocols, packaging integrity, and accelerated aging studies for sterile medical devices.

### 27. Human Factors Engineering (HFE) Assessment
Incorporates usability and human factors evaluation to identify use errors and assess critical task performance.

## Communication & Documentation

### 28. Multi-Lingual Content Management
Implements bilingual capability (Traditional Chinese with English terminology preservation) throughout all agents, demonstrating internationalization awareness.

### 29. Stakeholder-Specific Reporting
Creates differentiated outputs for different audiences: detailed technical reviews for specialists, executive briefs for management, and deficiency letters for sponsors.

### 30. Regulatory Timeline & Milestone Tracking
Implements systematic tracking of submission milestones, meetings, deficiency responses, and key communications for process management.

## Workflow Automation & Productivity

### 31. AI-Powered Workflow Acceleration ("Magic" Features)
Develops a suite of quick-action agents for common tasks (formatting, keyword extraction, action items, concept mapping, glossary creation) that enhance reviewer productivity through automated assistance for routine but time-consuming activities.
